#  0x03. Log Parsing

<p>For the “0x03. Log Parsing” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of Python programming, focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that you might find useful:</p>

## Concepts Needed:
<ol type="1">
    <li>File I/O in Python:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand how to read from sys.stdin line by line.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Signal Handling in Python:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Data Processing:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Parsing strings to extract specific data points.</li>
        <li>Aggregating data to compute summaries.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Regular Expressions:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Dictionaries in Python:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Exception Handling:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<p>By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be well-prepared to tackle the log parsing project, effectively handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics based on the processed data.</p>
