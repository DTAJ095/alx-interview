## Must Know
To successfully complete this project, you should revise the following Python concepts:
<ol type="1">
    <li>Lists and List Comprehensions:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand how to create, access, modify, and iterate over lists.</li>
        <li>Utilize list comprehensions for more concise and readable code, especially for generating rows of Pascal’s Triangle.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Functions:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Know how to define and call functions.</li>
        <li>Pass parameters and return values, particularly how to return a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Loops:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Use for and while loops to iterate through sequences.</li>
        <li>Nested loops may be necessary for generating each row and calculating the values of Pascal’s Triangle.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Conditional Statements:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
    Apply if, elif, and else conditions to implement logic based on the position within Pascal’s Triangle (e.g., the edges of the triangle always being 1).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Recursion (Optional):</li>
    <ul>
        <li>While not strictly necessary, understanding recursion can provide an alternative approach to generating Pascal’s Triangle.</li>
        <li>Recognize base cases and recursive cases for a function that generates the triangle’s rows.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Arithmetic Operations:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Perform addition, a fundamental operation for calculating each element of Pascal’s Triangle as the sum of the two elements directly above it.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Indexing and Slicing:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Access elements and slices of lists, crucial for identifying and summing the correct elements when constructing each row of the triangle.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Memory Management:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Be mindful of how lists are stored and copied, especially when creating new rows based on the values of the previous row.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Error and Exception Handling (Optional):</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Use try-except blocks as needed to handle potential errors, such as invalid input types or values.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Efficiency and Optimization:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider the time and space complexity of different approaches to generating Pascal’s Triangle.</li>
        <li>Evaluate and apply optimizations to improve the performance of the solution.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<p>By revisiting these concepts, you will be well-prepared to tackle the challenges of implementing Pascal’s Triangle in Python, applying both your mathematical understanding and programming skills to develop an efficient and effective solution.</p>
