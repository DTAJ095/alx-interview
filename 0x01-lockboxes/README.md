#  0x01. Lockboxes


# Must Know
For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:

## Concepts Needed:
<ol type="1">
    <li>Lists and List Manipulation:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.</li>
        <li>Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Graph Theory Basics:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.</li>
        <li>Graph Theory (Khan Academy)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Algorithmic Complexity:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.</li>
        <li>Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Recursion:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Queue and Stack:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.</li>
        <li>Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Set Operations:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.</li>
    </ul>

<p>By reviewing these concepts and utilizing these resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.</p>
