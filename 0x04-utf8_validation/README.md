#  0x04. UTF-8 Validation 

# Must Know
<p>For the “0x04. UTF-8 Validation” project, you will need to apply your knowledge in bitwise operations, understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that will be helpful:</p>

## Concepts Needed:
<ol type="1">
    <li>Bitwise Operations in Python:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), shifts (<<, >>).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>UTF-8 Encoding Scheme:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Familiarity with the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.</li>
        <li>Understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Data Representation:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>How to represent and work with data at the byte level.</li>
        <li>Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>List Manipulation in Python:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Boolean Logic:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
    Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<p>By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped to tackle the UTF-8 validation project, effectively applying bitwise operations and logical reasoning to determine the validity of UTF-8 encoded data.
